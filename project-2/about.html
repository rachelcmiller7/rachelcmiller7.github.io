      <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>The Fairfax County Park Foundation supports the Fairfax County Park Authority by raising private funds, obtaining grants and creating partnerships that supplement tax dollars to meet our community's needs for park land, facilities and services.</p>
        <p>The Fairfax County Park Authority receives less than 1% (0.6) of <a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/budget/" target="_blank">Fairfax County's General Fund budget</a>. While fees from recreation centers, golf courses, and classes provide for nearly 60% of the Park Authority's operating expenses, some programs and park facilities can't be fee-based. These areas are where<a href="https://fairfaxparkfoundation.org/our-projects/" target="_blank">the Foundation specifically provides support.</a></p>
