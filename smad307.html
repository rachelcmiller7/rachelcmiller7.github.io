     <p style="text-align: center;"> The SMAD 307 course is a continuation of what we learnt in SMAD 203 which I took last semester. We have been focusing on further developing our HTML and CSS skills while also introducing new elements such as <em>GitHub</em>. I have definately found this all a steep learning curve, but am starting to get the hang of things and feel more confident. To check out some of the work I've done so far in this class, just keep reading!</p>

     <h2 style="text-align: left;"> Learning GitHub</h2>
     <img src="images/github.jpg" style="max-width:25%; height: auto;">
     <p> <em>GitHub</em> was a new application introduced to us this semester and has been used to upload all of our work so far. We have learned how to create repositories, create branches and commit our changes to the master branch through an add-on to the <em>Brackets</em> application</p>.
